# Lecture 02 – Semantic HTML & Structure

## 1. What I implemented this lecture
- Built a personal portfolio page using semantic HTML
- Structured content using header, navigation, main sections, and footer
- Embedded images and a video using figure and figcaption
- Applied basic accessibility features

## 2. Semantic decisions I made (REQUIRED)

### Decision 1
- Element(s) used: `<header>`
- Where in the page: At the top of the page
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  The header contains the main title and introduction of the page, which represents the overall identity of the website.

### Decision 2
- Element(s) used: `<nav>`
- Where in the page: Below the header
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  The nav element groups the main navigation links, helping users and screen readers understand the site structure.

### Decision 3
- Element(s) used: `<section>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>`
- Where in the page: Inside the main content (portfolio section)
- Why this element is semantically correct:
  Sections divide the content into meaningful areas, while figure and figcaption correctly associate media with descriptions.

## 3. Accessibility considerations
- Included a skip-to-content link for keyboard users
- Added alternative text to images
- Used semantic HTML elements for better screen reader support
- Added a title attribute to the embedded video

These features improve navigation, readability, and usability for users with assistive technologies.

## 4. What I learned
- How to structure a webpage using semantic HTML
- Why semantic elements are important for accessibility
- How proper headings and landmarks improve page clarity

## 5. What I still need to improve
- Writing more descriptive alt texts
- Improving accessibility for embedded media
- Learning ARIA roles in more depth

## 6. Notes about AI usage (if any)
- Tool used: ChatGPT
- What I accepted as-is:
  General guidance on semantic HTML structure
- What I modified manually:
  Content wording, structure, and project details
